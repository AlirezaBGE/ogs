# How to contribute



## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target other branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git branch
    my_topic_branch master` then checkout the new branch with `git
    checkout my_topic_branch`.  Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your code conforms to the [styleguide][styleguide].
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
