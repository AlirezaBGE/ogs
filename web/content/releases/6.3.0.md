In this release the **Material Property Library** is significantly enriched with new constitutive relations and gets wide use in the processes.

Other significant changes are:

## Features

### Process' changes
 - Richards mechanics process now correctly computes porosity changes in presence of swelling. [#2825](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2825)
 - HydroMechanics process has now the option to use mass lumping. [#2826](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2826)
 - HydroMechanics process now uses permeability in tensor form with corresponding output. [#2848](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2848)
 - Reactive transport process has a mesh tag for restricting the place where chemical reactions take place within a specified subdomain. [#2851](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2851)

#### Numerics
 - Pass `x_dot` to processes' assemble functions. Used by rate-dependent material models. [#2795](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2795)
 - triangular elements with 7 integration points (order 4). [#2798](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2798)

#### Input and output

- Output of surface fluxes (for 2D and 3D bulk domains) for balance computations is now available for LiquidFlow process. [#2760](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2760)
 - Compute and output element-average porosity in RichardsMechanics process. [#2803](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2803)
 - Output of fixed time when using IterationBasedTimeStepping is now available. [#2831](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2831)

### Material models

 - Enable orthotropy in MFront solid material model interface. [#2774](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2774)
 - Enable shared medium definition for multiple materials. [#2786](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2786)
 - Implement van Genuchten saturation and relative permeability models in MPL. [#2788](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2788)
 - Convert processes to use MPL for the fluid and porous media models:
   - Hydro-mechanics. [#2779](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2779)
   - Richards-mechanics. [#2787](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2787)
   - LiquidFlow. [#2807](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2807)
   - GroundwaterFlow. [#2820](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2820)
 - Pass time increment dt to the material models. [#2801](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2801)
 - Add initialValue(x, t) for material properties. [#2804](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2804)
 - Implement mass balance porosity, used in RichardsMechanics. [#2804](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2804), [#2829](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2829)
 - Orthotropic permeability power law, used in RichardsMechanics. [#2813](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2813)
 - Implement saturation dependent swelling, used in RichardsMechanics. [#2819](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2819), [#2832](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2832)
 - Bishop's effective stress models; power law and saturation cutoff, used in RichardsMechanics. [#2823](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2823)

### File I/O

### Testing and documentation
- A new test verifies the correct conversion from *PropertyType* enum to string and back. [#2770](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2770)

### New tools

- ExtractEntireSurface: The tool extracts either lines in case of a 2D bulk mesh as input or quads/triangles in case of a 3D bulk mesh as input. [#2764](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2764)

## Infrastructure

- Added a Code of Conduct. [#2834](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2834)

### CMake options changes

- Added version requirements file in json-format to have a single source used by CMake and the web site generator. [#2783](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2783)
