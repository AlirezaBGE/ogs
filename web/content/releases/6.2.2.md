## Features

### Other process' changes
 - Surface sorption / desorption process implemented. [#2658](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2658)
 - Tag to fix amount of a KineticReactant in ChemistryLib. [#2638](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2638)
 - Replaced the material parameters of ThermoHydroMechanicsProcess with MPL. [#2614](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2614)
 - Explicit tag to set initial stresses in `SmallDeformation`, `ThermoMechancis`, `HydroMechanics`, and `RichardsMechanics` processes. [#2635](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2635)
 - Invoke material parameters that are associated with `component transport process` from MPL. [#2646](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2646)
 - Integrated another Phreeqc interface using direct memory access approach for reactive transport modeling. [#2640](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2640)
 - Replaced the specific material properties of TwoPhaseFlowWithPP with generalized MPL. [#2644](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2644)
 - Pass `dt` through interfaces instead of storage in process' data or coupled solutions. [#2673](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2673)

#### Numerics
 - Generalized implementation for specification of the non-equilibrium initial states. [#2633](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2633)
 - Bulk element point mapping for tetrahedrons added. [#2662](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2662)
 - Repeat time step if assembly failed. Specifically for MFront material models if the integration fails, the time step will be repeated given adaptive time stepping scheme. [#2730](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2730)

#### Boundary condition
 - Add possibility to specify 'lower' dimensional Robin/Neumann boundary conditions. [#2710](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2710)

#### Source term
 - Line source terms are available. [#2685](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2685)

#### Input and output
 - [HT] Test if all the needed material properties read from project file. [#2727](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2727)
 - Extend internal state variables (MFront) output to TM, RM, and HM. [#2732](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2732)

### Material models
 - New ParameterProperty can be used for heterogeneous spatial distributed MPL properties. [#2616](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2616), [#2683](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2683)
 - Include MFrontGenericInterface as submodule and update to version tfel-3.2.1. [#2631](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2631)
 - Add Mohr-Coulomb-Abbo-Sloan (and its orthotropic version) to MFront material models. [#2634](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2634)
 - Extend `LinearProperty` for linear dependency upon multiple dependent variables. [#2649](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2649)
 - New `IdealGasLaw` MPL property for pure phases consisting of ideal gases. [#2651](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2651)
 - New MPL property `Saturation` based on the Brooks and Corey material model. [#2652](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2652)
 - New MPL property `Relative Permeability` based on the Brooks and Corey material model. [#2656](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2656)
 - New MPL properties `Saturation` and `Relative Permeability` according to the original Liakopoulos multiphase flow experiment. [#2657](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2657)

### File I/O

 - A no longer used `RapidStnInterface` for `stn` files is dropped. The used `XmlStnInterface` remains. [#2609](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2609)

### New tools
- command line utility to interpolate equidistant raster files between two boundary rasters (for vertical refinement of subsurface layers). [#2621](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2621)
- command line utility to convert 2D meshes into ESRI shape files. [#2627](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2627)
- command line utility to convert netCDF-files into OGS meshes. [#2654](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2654)
- command line utility for for 3D mesh to grid conversion. [#2704](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2704)

### Other notable code changes

- Split BuildInfo from BaseLib into separate libs to reduce re-linking after changes in the info variables. [#2625](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2625)
