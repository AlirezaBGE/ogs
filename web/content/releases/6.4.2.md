## Overview

Some of the highlights of this release are lots of improvements to the computation of TRM and TH2M problems in parallel with PETSc and Taylor-Hood Elements, the new HDF5-based input/output routines and the introduction of Jupyter Notebook based benchmarks (see an [example](https://www.opengeosys.org/docs/benchmarks/notebooks/diffusionsorptiondecay/)).

### Bug fixes

* [!3932](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3932) Fixed several memory leaks and access bugs.
* [!3956](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3956) THM: Fix temperature equation for case w/o thermal osmosis.
* [!3978](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3978) Fix access of transport porosity as medium property in TRM.
* [!3919](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3919)
 Enable node search function work under MPI.
* [!4021](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/4021) Fixes pyramid integration for integration order 1. Note, the location of the single integration point was changed! If you have any restart data with integration order 1, the respective location will silently change. However, that seems acceptable since before the pyramid order 1 integration was just wrong.
* [!4051](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/4051) Changes the input storage order of tensorial properties of MPL. Now it is row major, before it was column major. The new row major storage order is the storage order that naturally arises in prj files. The old behavior was not a bug per se, but could very likely lead to subtle errors with asymmetric tensorial properties.
* [!4055](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/4055) Fixing a bug in Process::setInitialConditions under PETSc.

### CMake

* [!3910](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3910) Updated Conan CMake integration.
* [!3940](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3940) Select lld over GNU gold over regular linker. Speeds up link times.
* [!3950](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3950), [!4030](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/4030) Added option ~~`OGS_INSTALL_PETSC`~~ `OGS_INSTALL_EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES` to install (locally build) PETSc or MFront / TFEL into `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.
* [!3951](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3951) Removed `std::filesystem` hacks for older compilers.
* [!3983](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3983) [cmake] Refactored (and fixed) processes setup logic.
* [!3989](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3989), [!3995](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3995) Offline build with cpm and external dependencies cache. See [docs](https://www.opengeosys.org/docs/devguide/advanced/offline-build).
* [!3999](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3999) Added option `OGS_DEPENDENCY_VERSIONS` to overwrite entries in versions.json.
* [!4001](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/4001), [!4056](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/4056) Use a better FindMKL.cmake which includes also linker flags.

* [!4041](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/4041) Replaced poetry by simple python / pip calls:
  - Poetry is not required anymore for automatic Python package installation. Only a Python interpreter is required (nowadays they already include `venv` and `pip`).
  - Renamed CMake option `OGS_USE_POETRY` to `OGS_USE_PIP` (which now defaults to `OFF`!). Before poetry was used per default when it was found, now this behavior is reversed (needs to explicitly switched to `ON`).
* [!4059](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/4059) Added --download-hypre to local CPM build.

### Infrastructure

* [!3874](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3874) Allow utils build on PETSc config.
* [!3876](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3876) Added Jupyter image with PETSc support, image name: `registry.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/ogs-petsc-jupyter`.
* [!3597](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/merge_requests/3597) Added CI linux build with debug checks, address and undefined behaviour sanitizers.
