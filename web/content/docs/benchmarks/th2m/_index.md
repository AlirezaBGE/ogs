## Benchmark hierarchy

Some of the collected benchmarks for the TH2M process can be accessed here. Since fully coupled benchmarks are very rare, and since the TH2M process is rather complex, part of the benchmark hierarchy presented and described in Grunwald et al [2020]({{< relref "publications/paper.md#grunwald2020">}}) and [2022]({{< relref "publications/paper.md#grunwald2022">}}) is provided here.
This hierarchical ordering of test examples reduces the complex system of equations to simpler combinations of the individual physical processes. Each of the reasonable subsets of process combinations is tested against closed-form solutions, the results of physical experiments, or by comparison with other codes.
