## Problem description

**Note**, this project file runs only with a modified version of OGS
which you can find [here](https://github.com/KeitaYoshioka/ogs/tree/H2M_phasefield).

We simulate two different fluid percolation experiments performed on rock salt samples with a true tri-axial loading system as described in [this PDF](./Yoshioka_percolation.pdf). The experiments were performed under two different stress configurations as below.

## Results and evaluation

Simulated crack paths (phase-field) for the two cases are shown below:
