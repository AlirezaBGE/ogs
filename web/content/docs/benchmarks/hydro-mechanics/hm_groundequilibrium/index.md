## Test cases

Four versions of the test are presented:

- {{< data-link "Gravity load" "HydroMechanics/GroundEquilibrium/simHM_ground.prj" >}},
- {{< data-link "Gravity load with Python BCs" "HydroMechanics/GroundEquilibrium/simHM_ground_python.prj" >}},
- {{< data-link "Gravity load and indentation" "HydroMechanics/GroundEquilibrium/simHM_ground_quadBCu.prj" >}}, and
- {{< data-link "Gravity load and indentation with Python BCs" "HydroMechanics/GroundEquilibrium/simHM_ground_quadBCu_python.prj" >}}.

## Problem description

We assume a two-dimensional piece of ground (linear elastic soil saturated with water) and consider two cases: The static equilibrium state under gravity load, and the temporal evolution under some additional indentation from the top. The corresponding boundary conditions are either coded directly in the prj-file or provided by *pythonBCsOGS.py* using the Python interface.
See [this PDF](HM_GroundEquilibrium.pdf) for the detailed description.
